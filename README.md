For the last year of Collège (Swiss equivalent of high-school), all students have to present a personal project called Travail de Maturité.
I chose to create an iOS game to show how the process of learning to program, developping an app and submit it to an app store.

The inspiration for it came from the Sort or 'Splode mini-game in New Super Mario Bros.
